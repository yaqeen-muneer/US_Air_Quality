# *When Air Speaks : A Tale of U.S. Air Quality (2019–2023)*

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **air quality trends in the United States between 2019 and 2023**, highlighting the rise in the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** and its implications for public health and the forces behind it. It also compares U.S. air quality with India which had different view of AQI, exploring the role of **fossil fuel energy generation, seasonal variation, and pollutant chemistry** in shaping outcomes.  

The project was developed to end my Data Analytics Bootcamp Journey as my **Capstone Presentation** and is designed to communicate complex environmental data in a clear, engaging, and educational format.

## Objectives
- Quantify changes in U.S. AQI from 2019–2023.
- Identify **seasonal, hourly, and geographic variations** in pollutant concentrations and AQI.
- Explain scientific reasoning of trends like **tropospheric ozone formation** and **tempreature inversion lid**.
- Compare U.S. and Indian air quality trends, linking them to **energy generation** and other factors.
- Provide **policy and energy recommendations** for improving air quality in the U.S.

## Data Sources
- **U.S. EPA**: AQI and pollutant concentration datasets.  
- **Indian CPCB**: AQI and pollutant concentration datasets.  
- **Energy Statistics (EMPER ENERGY)**: Fossil fuel electricity generation (2000–2024).  
- **Temperature Records (NCEI)**: daily averages.

## Key Insights
- U.S. AQI rose **31%** between 2019–2023, moving away from the “Good” range.  
- **Seasonal variation**: Summer shows highest AQI, winter the lowest.  
- **Hourly cycles**: O<sub>3</sub> peaks when sunlight breaks NO<sub>2</sub>, other peak at midnight due to temperature inversion lid.
- **Geographic disparities**: The top state with the worst AQI is Ilinois, while California cities (Fontana, Rubidoux, Victorville) consistently rank worst despite it being in a good AQI range.
- **Cross-boarders comparison**: India’s AQI levels are significantly higher, driven by coal-heavy energy generation, high temperature and dense population.
